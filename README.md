The aim of the project was to create a dashboard which will give necessary information about the blood banks in every state such as number of blood banks, service-time, contact numbers, etc.

Steps I followed:
1. Import dataset in PowerBi
2. Clean and Transform the Data using Power Query
3. Create visualizations
